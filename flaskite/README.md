# Virtual Environment 

The virtual environment is setup in powershell using: 

```
python -m venv .venv
```

Activating may first require a change to execution policies in Power Shell: 

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
``` 
Activate the virtual environment in PowerShell by running: 
```
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

Success is visible when the path begins with (.venv)
